DATA CLEANING
1. adjust columns data types 
2. handling missing values
3. look if our dataset is imbalanced or not
since our dataset is imbalanced we need to apply appropriate technique to balance it like SMOTE, ADASYN or any other based on the needs

to apply such techniques we need to convert our data into numeric data, converting the dates difference, categorical to numeric and then apply this technique

berfore we convert into categorical it is important to select which categorical features are important for us only then we convert them
